This package contains some helper functions to perform statistical data interpretation using
the RooStats package which is part of the ROOT framework (root.cern.ch).

1. Requirements
===============

This package was tested with ROOT Version v6.02.08 with the roofit feature enabled.

2. Installation/Compilation
===========================

After having setup ROOT, the package can be compiled by invoking

> make

on the command line. As a result, the lib/ directory will be created containing the shared library.
In addition, a test executable is created in the directory bin/.

3. Usage
========

Before you can use the shared library/run the test porgramme, you need to include the lib/
directory into the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This can be achieved by sourcing
the setup script

> source RooStatsToolsenv.sh

Afterwards, you can run the test programme. By calling

> ./bin/GaussLimitPlot --help

you will get a list of the avaiable options. This programme calculates the upper limits/confidence
interval for the mean (restricted to be >= 0) from a normal distributed random variable.
